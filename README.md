# Synthetic-Dataset-Generation-with-Faker

# Introduction
The commonly over-used phrase “data is the new oil (or gold)” genuinely holds somewhat true in many scenarios where obtaining sufficient high-quality data for undertaking insightful analyses or building effective machine learning models becomes a challenge. Synthetic data generation is, therefore, a frequently resorted-to approach to cope with this challenge. Thanks to Python libraries like Faker, generating synthetic data for purposes such as bootstrapping existing datasets, testing, or even anonymizing sensitive information is easier than ever.

This article introduces the Faker library for generating synthetic datasets. Through a gentle hands-on tutorial, we will explore how to generate single records or data instances, full datasets in one go, and export them into different formats. The code walkthrough adopts a twofold perspective:

**1. Learning:** We will gain a basic understanding of several data types that can be generated and how to get them ready for further processing, aided by popular data-intensive libraries like Pandas

**2.Testing:** With some generated data at hand, we will provide some hints on how to test data issues in the context of a simplified ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that ingests synthetically generated transactional data.
